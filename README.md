Technical Notes
---------------
QudUX 2.0 now relies primarily on Harmony injection to make its modifications, which is a far simpler (and more performant) framework than the Unity MonoBehavior polling that was previously used. Caves of Qud supports Harmony injection natively; Harmony is packaged with the game executable.
